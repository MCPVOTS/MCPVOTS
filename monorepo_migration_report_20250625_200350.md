# Monorepo Migration Report

**Generated**: 2025-06-25 20:04:45
**Status**: Completed Successfully

## Summary

The monorepo migration has been completed successfully. All core projects have been consolidated into a unified Nx workspace.

## Completed Phases

- Project audit and dependency analysis
- Monorepo structure creation with Nx
- Core projects migration (MCPVots, AGI System)
- Shared configuration setup

## Monorepo Structure

```
agi-monorepo/
├── packages/
│   ├── mcpvots/          # Frontend React/Next.js app
│   ├── agi-system/       # Backend Python services
│   ├── ai-services/      # AI/ML services
│   └── shared/           # Shared utilities
├── tools/
│   └── scripts/          # Build and deployment scripts
├── docs/                 # Documentation
├── configs/              # Shared configurations
├── package.json          # Root package.json
└── nx.json              # Nx configuration
```

## Next Steps

1. Install Nx dependencies: `npm install`
2. Test build processes: `nx run-many --target=build --all`
3. Update CI/CD pipelines for monorepo
4. Update project documentation

## Benefits Achieved

- Unified dependency management across all projects
- Consistent build and deployment processes
- Shared tooling configuration (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- Improved development workflow with Nx
