# Tools Directory

This folder contains utility scripts, analyzers, and alternative trading implementations for the MAXX Ecosystem.

## Categories

- **Analyzers**: Scripts for analyzing transactions, burns, intelligence, etc.
- **Traders**: Alternative or experimental trading bots
- **Utilities**: Helper scripts for balances, DB checks, etc.
- **Backups**: Backup versions of core systems
- **Clients**: API clients for various services

## Usage

Run scripts from the root directory using `python tools/script_name.py` or update paths as needed.

Note: Core trading uses `maxx_trader_fix.py` at root. CLI tools like `buy_maxx_cli.py` import from here.
