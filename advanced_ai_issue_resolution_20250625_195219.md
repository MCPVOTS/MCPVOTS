## ðŸ”§ Key Findings

### Security Issues
- Hardcoded credentials detected in multiple files
- API keys need to be moved to environment variables
- Security TODOs added for immediate attention

### Complexity Issues
- Several functions exceed recommended length (>50 lines)
- Deeply nested code structures identified
- Refactoring TODOs added for improvement

### Performance Issues
