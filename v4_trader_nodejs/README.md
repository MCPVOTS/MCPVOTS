# Uniswap V4 Trading - Current Status

## Problem Identified

The Universal Router at `0x6fF5693b99212Da76ad316178A184AB56D299b43` on Base doesn't support standard V4 swaps yet, or uses a completely different encoding than documented.

**Evidence:**
- TX Hash: `0xdb43e09cc47c8b6d71d25f9f355989b097915441f7db8f287192ace1c6eb47e2`
- Status: Reverted (60,307 gas used)
- Transaction data was empty despite our encoding attempts

## The Core Issue

Uniswap V4 is fundamentally different from V2/V3:
1. **No direct pool contracts** - pools are managed by the PoolManager singleton
2. **Hooks system** - customizable logic that complicates encoding
3. **Flash accounting** - requires specific locking/unlocking patterns
4. **Limited documentation** - V4 is still very new

## What We Tried

### Python Attempts (FAILED)
- Manual encoding of Universal Router commands
- TX Hash: `0x625ea1dce8c765586a693b0953c513a71afe89f51d5dd209cbac7bc6f9092d85`
- Problem: Incorrect ExactInputSingleParams encoding

### Node.js Attempt (FAILED)
- Used ethers.js with manual command encoding
- TX Hash: `0xdb43e09cc47c8b6d71d25f9f355989b097915441f7db8f287192ace1c6eb47e2`
- Problem: Commands didn't match router expectations

## The Real Problem

**V4 may not be production-ready on Base yet**. The pool exists with $55K liquidity, but:
- The Universal Router might not route to V4 pools
- Trading might only work through direct PoolManager interaction (complex)
- Or there's a different router contract we don't know about

## Current Balances

- **ETH:** 0.003083 ETH ($12.38)
- **MAXX:** 921.71 MAXX

## Options Moving Forward

### Option 1: Use V2 (User Rejected)
The V2 router works perfectly. Multiple successful trades executed:
- Sell TX: `0xa7f1517...`
- Buy TXs: `0x812e09b...`, `0xe1d0031...`

**User's concern:** "v2 is dead we lose money"
**Reality:** V2 still has liquidity and works fine

### Option 2: Wait for Official V4 SDK Update
The `@uniswap/v4-sdk` package exists but may not support Base chain yet.

### Option 3: Direct PoolManager Integration (Very Complex)
Would require:
- Understanding the locking mechanism
- Implementing callbacks
- Complex abi encoding for swap parameters
- Risk of errors and lost funds

### Option 4: Find Working V4 Examples
Look for actual working V4 trades on BaseScan and reverse engineer the transaction data.

## Recommendation

**For production trading right now:**
1. Use V2 router (proven to work)
2. Monitor slippage carefully
3. Use proper slippage protection (we had 0 minimum output)
4. Wait for V4 to mature

**The "money loss" on V2 is likely due to:**
- No slippage protection (amountOutMinimum = 0)
- Not slippage issues with V2 itself

We can add proper slippage calculation to V2 trades to solve this.
