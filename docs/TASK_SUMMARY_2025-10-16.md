# Task Summary — 2025-10-16

Scope

- Wire a small, safe update to `DASHBOARD/MATRIX_DASHBOARD_ULTRA.html`.
- Finish and polish `ANIMEJS_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`.
- Produce this concise task summary.

Changes

- Dashboard HTML:
  - Added WebSocket URL override support via `?ws=` query string or saved localStorage. Press `s` to set URL and auto-reconnect.
  - Normalized incoming WebSocket messages to a stable schema (accepts `type`/`event` and `data`/`payload`; maps `trade_execution`→`trade`, etc.).
  - Safer reconnect logging and status updates.
- Anime.js Guide:
  - Added Quickstart and Tips sections.
  - Standardized defaults (ws://localhost:8080/ws) and code samples.
  - Fixed markdown lint (headings, code fence languages, blank lines, trailing newline).

How to use

- Open the dashboard via a local server and connect:
  - Example: <http://localhost:8000/DASHBOARD/MATRIX_DASHBOARD_ULTRA.html?ws=ws://localhost:8080/ws>
  - Or press `s` on the dashboard to input a WS URL; it will reconnect and persist.
- The dashboard accepts events with shapes like:
  - `{ type: "price_update", data: { price: 0.000123 } }`
  - `{ event: "trade_execution", payload: { symbol: "MAXX", amount_maxx: 100 } }`

Notes

- Edits were non-invasive; no backend code changed.
- The dashboard still defaults to ws://localhost:8080/ws if no override is provided.

Next ideas (optional)

- Add a small connection badge tooltip showing the active WS URL.
- Gate animations with Reduced Motion preference for accessibility.
- Provide a tiny mock WS broadcaster for local demo.
