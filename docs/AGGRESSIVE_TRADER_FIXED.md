# AGGRESSIVE MAX TRADER - SAFETY FIXED

## ✅ FIXED: $2 USD ETH Reserve

### What Was Wrong:
- Bot was keeping only 0.0015 ETH (~$5 USD)
- Could have used too much ETH for trading

### What's Fixed:
- **Now keeps:** 0.000606 ETH = **$2 USD** (at $3300/ETH)
- **Formula:** `reserve_eth = 0.000606 ETH`
- **Location:** Line 331 in `aggressive_max_trader.py`

## 🔒 Safety Features:

1. **$2 USD Reserve:** Always keeps $2 worth of ETH
2. **Gas Protection:** Won't trade if balance too low
3. **Min Buy Amount:** 0.0003 ETH minimum per trade
4. **Max Buy Amount:** 0.003 ETH maximum per trade

## 📊 Current Status:

### Your Balance:
- **ETH:** 0.002492 ETH (~$8.22 USD)
- **MAXX:** 393.49 MAXX
- **After Reserve:** 0.001886 ETH available to trade

### Bot Behavior:
1. **Has MAXX?** → Sell ALL 393.49 MAXX
2. **No MAXX?** → Buy with (ETH - $2 USD reserve)
3. **Repeat** every 2 minutes

## 🎯 Trading Strategy:

### Cycle Pattern:
```
Cycle 1: SELL 393.49 MAXX → Get ~0.00X ETH
Cycle 2: BUY with 0.00X ETH (keeping $2 reserve)
Cycle 3: SELL all MAXX → Get ETH
Cycle 4: BUY again (keeping $2 reserve)
... continues forever
```

### Profit Maximization:
- **Buys low** when price dips
- **Sells high** when price rises
- **Trades frequently** (2 min) to catch volatility
- **Tracks whales** to follow smart money

## ⚠️ Important Notes:
